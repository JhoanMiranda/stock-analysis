## Steve Stock Analysis  



This analysis was made with the purpose of guiding Steve’s parents acquiring stocks, because the one that they choose at the beginning wasn’t that good after all (that’s how the analysis started just with “DQ” but Steve wanted to go deeper and see how the overall stocks behaved during those two years.

## Process

Data after been analyzed was filtered by year and ticker, doing this we could get the total volume of each stock and the percentage performed each year.

Thinking about the end user we pu some visual aids to it, giving them the option to choose  the year and with a color code highlighting the outcome of the whole year and then clear the date and choose different year

Steve wanted to get faster results that’s why we refactor the code, creating new Variables and some Arrays we could optimized the time of processing the info modifying the way how the loops search for data

## Summary

1.	The advantage of refactoring a code is that most of the times we can get better results with whatever results we got in the first place. 

2.	If is not performed correctly can damage the whole code and if you’re not prepared to that (Saving and Pushing the data often) you can lose the work and time that you put into it.
